<h1>COVID-19 UPDATES</h1>
<h2>11/17/2020 - OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO YOUR HEALTH, COMFORT AND SAFETY</h2>
<p>In preparation for cold season shopping, all stores have been outfitted with Blueair air purifiers. We continue to limit the number of people in the stores at one time, sanitize our spaces regularly, wash our hands and observe social distancing.  Please wear a mask at all times when shopping, whether in store or on our lot.</p>

<p>But the BIG news is that there are THREE DIFFERENT WAYS you can shop Mother Earth Gardens this season!</p>

<ol>
<li>ONLINE!</li>
<p>That’s right!! We’re reopening an online shop for the season (and beyond?) so you can shop a selection of pottery, plants, decor, gardening stuff and sweet gifts from the warmth and comfort of your home (no trees or other holiday greens available online). Orders placed online will be available for walk-up/walk-in pick up from the location of your choice (no curbside pick-up available)! The webstore has launched - click here to shop!</p>

<li>OUTDOORS!</li>
<p> an herbicide-free Christmas tree, wreath, winter container, swag or other green holiday things for your home, you’ll be able to pay without having to step inside! Our South Mpls store has a brand new walk-up window. NE Mpls will have a mobile card reader - just let a staff member know when you’re ready to check out!</p>

<li> THE SHOP!</li>
<p>We continue to observe capacity limits in our small stores, so we'll have to work together to keep our distance. You may, on occasion, encounter a line, because of the vagaries of Covid.</p>
</ol>

<p> We look forward to seeing your eyeballs during this strange season, whether strolling through our lot, in our funky fun shop or for a hot second to pick up your online order! </p>
